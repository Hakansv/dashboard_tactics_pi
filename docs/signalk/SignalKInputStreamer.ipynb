Filters shall be applied only at user's demand so that the observer is always in control.

Of course, the boat's own electronics play an equally important role in this, but since we cannot present an universal model for those, let's study the signal chain from the point onwards where it enters OpenCPN, _i.e._ from USB serial line or WiFi/Ethernet TCP/IP communication in our case."

But it is less useful for a data acquisition system unless there is a prioritization schema which allows the data event dealt with as a high priority interrupt which allows the continous transport of the arrived data all the way through the system. But if we would follow such as principle, the actual GUI operation could become sluggish and, in general the priority is given to the graphical elements visible to user."
